<p>WooCommerce is a popular e-commerce plugin that offers a lot of flexibility, with a solid and well designed codebase.</p>

<p><strong>The WooCommerce plugin is not an SEO plugin or a social sharing plugin</strong>, so its Schema markup for search engines and social sites is minimal - and its social meta tags for Facebook, Twitter, and other social sites are non-existent.</p>

<p>You may have found your way to this webpage after sharing a WooCommerce product page on Facebook, Pinterest or other social sites - or maybe testing a product page using <a href="https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/">Google's Structured Data Testing Tool</a> - and being unimpressed with the default markup from WooCommerce. The following guide provides a quick and easy way to improve how your WooCommerce products look when displayed in search results and shared on social sites. Having error-free, complete and accurate Schema markup will definitely improve your Google search ranking - significantly in some instances. :)</p>

<h3>Common Warnings for WooCommerce Markup</h3>

<p><a href="https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/">Google's Structured Data Testing Tool</a>, and/or <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console">Google's Search Console</a> for site owners, may report one or more of the following errors for the default Schema markup offered by WooCommerce:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The aggregateRating field is recommended.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>The brand field is recommended.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>The review field is recommended.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>This Product is missing a global identifier (e.g. isbn, mpn or gtin8).</strong></li>
	<li><strong>No global identifier provided (e.g. gtin mpn isbn).</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>aggregateRating</em> warning from WooCommerce's Schema markup can be addressed by having your customers leave one or more reviews for each of your products. Unfortunately, products without any reviews will not have an <em>aggregateRating</em> value (see bellow for a solution).</p>

<p>If your product has several reviews, WooCommerce will only include the <strong>last review</strong> in the Schema Product markup, which may not reflect the <em>aggregateRating</em> values - which are calculated from all reviews, not just the last one (see bellow for a solution).</p>

<p>All product reviews (ie. that have a rating value) and comments (ie. that do not rating value) are combined by WooCommerce into a separate, disconnected Schema JSON-LD block for reviews, no matter if a review or comment has a rating value or not (see bellow for a solution).</p>

<p>The following values should be included in the Schema markup when available, but WooCommerce cannot manage this information without using 3rd party plugins and coding complex filters for its Schema markup (see bellow for a solution).</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Brand</strong></li>
	<li><strong>GTIN-14</strong></li>
	<li><strong>GTIN-13</strong> (aka UPC)</li>
	<li><strong>GTIN-12</strong> (aka EAN)</li>
	<li><strong>GTIN-8</strong></li>
	<li><strong>ISBN</strong></li>
	<li><strong>MPN</strong> (aka Manufacturer Part Number)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
	<p>Although Google does not complain about the lack of a <em>mainEntity</em> or <em>mainEntityOfPage</em> value, this property should be included to make sure Google recognizes the Schema Product markup as the main content of the webpage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>WPSSO - An Easy Solution for Better Schema</h3>

<div class="wp-block-image">
	<figure class="alignright">
		<img src="https://wpsso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpsso-and-woocommerce-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13659"/>

</div>

<p>The combination of the <a href="https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/?utm_source=wpsso&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=better-schema-for-woocommerce">WPSSO Core Premium plugin</a> and its <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/">WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup add-on</a> (Standard or Premium) addresses all the Schema markup weaknesses from WooCommerce, and includes many more Schema product properties for Google - not to mention complete social meta tags for Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter, and more. ;-)</p>

<p>WPSSO offers an option to include <em>aggregateRating</em> and <em>review</em> properties for all your products, even if they do not have any reviews - and if your products have reviews (ie. with a star rating) and comments (ie. no rating value), they will be classified properly - added to the Schema Product markup as "reviews" and "comments" respectfully.</p>

<p>WooCommerce provides only a single product offer in its Schema markup - even for variable products with different pricing - while WPSSO includes all product variation offers, grouped by currency, with complete product details for each offer (description, image, mpn, sku, gtin, item condition, availability, price, currency, VAT added, etc.).</p>

<p>WPSSO includes product prices without VAT (by default) or can optionally include VAT in the offer prices. WPSSO also includes the WooCommerce product and variation image, weight, width, height, and length values for each offer.</p>

<p>WPSSO supports many additional WooCommerce product and variation attributes as well, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Brand</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Color</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Condition</strong> (possible values: Damaged, New, Refurbished, or Used)</li>
	<li><strong>Depth</strong></li>
	<li><strong>GTIN-14</strong></li>
	<li><strong>GTIN-13</strong> (aka UPC)</li>
	<li><strong>GTIN-12</strong> (aka EAN)</li>
	<li><strong>GTIN-8</strong></li>
	<li><strong>GTIN</strong></li>
	<li><strong>ISBN</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong></li>
	<li><strong>MPN</strong> (aka Manufacturer Part Number)</li>
	<li><strong>Size</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Gender</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Volume</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="https://wpsso.com/docs/plugins/wpsso/installation/integration/woocommerce-integration/">WooCommerce integration notes</a> for details on different ways you can include this product information in your WooCommerce shop (ie. using an add-on for WPSSO Core, a supported 3rd party plugin, WooCommerce Product Attributes, WordPress Custom Fields, or customized values in a Document SSO metabox).</p>
